Hello world,

Welcome to the virtual store "Bamazon."

The shopping experience takes place as follows:

When the app is initialized, a list of all available items for sale is displayed, and the user is asked if they are interested in purchasing any items.  

If they are intersted in shopping, they will be asked what item they would like to buy by referencing the Product ID of the item.  

They will be charged the sales price of the item, multiplied by the amount quantity of the item they are purchasing, and then the item(s) will be minused from the database inventory.

Then, the shopper is asked if they would like to continue shopping.  If so, the process will repeat and if they are finished the program will quit.  

Side note: I have this error that i think is due to me inadvertantly installing some screwy NPMs on my computer on friday.. i googled the error response, and others out there on the interwebs have recieved the same message... it seeems like it does not harm the app, it appears to only be nuisance extra characters.
